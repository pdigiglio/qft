We obtain that the number $N$ of particles is no more a conserved
quantity, even in fundamental processes.
In fact, in \ac{rr} particles can be produced if there is plenty of energy.
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\psi}\!\bra{\psi} = \sum_{j} \abs{c_j}^2\ket{\psi_j}\!\bra{\psi_j} + 
	\sum_{i\neq j}\cc{c}_i c_j\ket{\psi_j}\!\bra{\psi_i}
\end{equation}
The second sum is the one that gives rise to interference phenomena.
