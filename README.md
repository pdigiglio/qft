This repository has been set up to transcribe in LaTeX the notes taken
from prof. Claudio Destri's lectures about __Quantum Field Theory__ on academic
year 2013/14.


## System requirements

To compile the document you need to have a LaTeX distribution (e.g.
[_TeXLive_](https://www.tug.org/texlive/ "Go to TeXLive web site"))
properly installed on your machine. Once you've pulled the repository
on your locale, you just need to run `make`.
