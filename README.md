This repository has been set up to transcribe in LaTeX the notes taken
from prof. Claudio Destri's lectures about Quantum Field Theory on academic
year 2013/14.


# Requirements

To compile the document you need to have a LaTeX distribution (e.g.
_TeXLive_) properly installed on your machine. Once you've pulled the
repository on your locale, you just need to run `make`.
